//
//   GET /MyPage 200 in 35 ms   (plus method, path, status, durationMs, userId)
//
// The line is JSON, so Cloud Logging keeps each field separately and you can
// search by them (jsonPayload.status>=500, jsonPayload.path="/Admin") instead
// of matching text. One complete line per request, rather than lines scattered
// through the code, means one search answers "what happened to that request?".
//
// The logger also stamps the line with Google's trace id for the request, so
// the Logs Explorer shows it inside Cloud Run's own entry for that request.
//
// What never goes in: cookies, tokens, request bodies (students' sentences)
// and query strings. Logs are kept for 30 days and anyone with access to the
// Google Cloud project can read them.
